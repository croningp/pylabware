    # Introduction
    
    BUCHI's OpenInterface provides full control and access to all data an instrument produces and consumes. 
    It is the programmatic equivalent to the device's on-screen menu.


    # Common use cases

    ## Process control/monitoring

    - Start / stop distillations
    
    - Adjust process parameters (e.g. set vacuum during distillation)
    
    - Monitor running distillations
    
    - Receive notifcations when distillations start and automatically or manually stop (e.g. CloudDest)
    
    - Unify settings across multiple devices (e.g. in regulated environments)
    
    - Monitor instrument usage/availability (e.g. for asset management software)
    
    - Monitor for unexpected events (e.g. errors)
    
  

    ## Function level control

    - Start / stop of individual functions (e.g. rotation, heating, cooling)
    
    - Integrate Vacuum Pump V-300/V-600 / Interface I-300 Pro into 3rd party systems


    # Getting started
    
    ## Wiring and IP configuration
    
    Ensure that the I-300pro is connected to your network. Either configure a fixed IP address on the Rotavapor System or set up an address reservation on your DHCP server in order to ensure that your Rotavapor system is always reachable under the same IP address.
    
    ## Enable OpenInterface
    
    Enable the OpenInterface using the I-300pro on-screen menu. Take note of the passwords and restart the device.
    On your computer, open a web browser and enter the IP address of your system. A webpage that shows the current status of the OpenInterface should be displayed.
    
    ## Explore the API
    
    Use [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) or it's open-source alternative [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) for exploring the OpenInterface. Both tools allow importing this OpenAPI spec. Once imported, a few more things need to be configured.
    
    - _Disable Certificate Validation:_ In Postman this can be done under File > Settings > General > SSL Certificate Validation
    
    - _Enter Rotavapor IP Address:_ Change base URL to contain your Rotavapor's IP address under Edit Collection > Variables
    
    - _Add credentials:_ Under Edit Collection > Authentication choose Basic Auth, enter rw as user and the password that was shown on screen of the I-300pro at the time you've enabled the OpenInterface.
    
    Afterwards you should be able to use Postman for exploring the API.

    
    # Authentication

    Basic Auth is used. This is one of the simplest forms of
    authentication and involves a username and password being sent along by the
    client in the HTTP header of each request.
    
    
    ```
    Authorization: Basic <credentials>
    ```
     where `<credentials>` is `username:password` encoded in Base64


    There are two predefined users, `rw` and `ro`. It is not possible to define additional users. The passwords are generated and displayed on the I-300 Pro on-screen menu at the time the OpenInterface is activated. It's not possible to see this passwords at a later time. The password can be reset by re-enabling the OpenInterface functionality.

    # Authorization

    The authorization is hard-wired to the two default users. 
    
    
    `ro` is limited to read-only access 
    
    
    `rw` has full read/write/control access

    # Security

    The OpenInterface is disabled by default and explicitly needs to be activated via the I-300 Pro on-screen menu. The OpenInterface enforces encrypted communication using TLS. It  uses a self-signed certificate that is generated for the device's IP once the API is activated. There is a shared root certificate that can be used for validation.
    
    # Units
    
    - [SI units](https://www.bipm.org/en/measurement-units/) for temperature, pressure, etc. unless mentioned otherwise
    
    - Date/time in accordance to [RFC 3339, section 5.6](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6) and [ISO8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html)

    # Discovery

    No discovery features are offered. The instrument's IP address can be determined by using its on-screen menu.

    # Versioning

    The version of the API is part of the URL.

    # Hardware Requirements

    The open interface requires at least an Interface I-300 Pro. To provide real benefits at least the VacuBox and one additional device is required (e.g. Rotavapor R-300).

    # Webhooks
    
    Webhooks are the web's callbacks. It's a lightweight low-latency alternative for status and error monitoring where polling would be disproportionate.
    This also allows passing events to services like [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/), [Microsoft Flow](https://flow.microsoft.com/), or [Zapier](https://zapier.com/).
    
    The OpenInterface is used for managing the webhook registrations. A webhook registration at the bare minumum is an URL and a list of Rotavapor Events. Whenever such an event occurs, the rotavapor will call that URL. 
    
    Currently there is support for text payloads (e.g. XML, JSON, etc). Binary payloads aren't supported.
    

    ## Payload Templates

    When registering for a webhook a payload template containing placeholders can be
    provided. The placeholders are then populated with corresponding data at the
    time the event occurs.
    Currently only text templates are supported (e.g. JSON, XML, CSV, etc.)


    ## Certificate verification

    Trusted roots are downloaded from the cloud at instrument start. If the
    instrument has no internet access, the “disableCertCheck” flag should be set
    when registering webhooks in order to ensure that the webhook is called even
    when the instrument is unable to properly verify the server's certificate.  


    ## Authentication

    When registering a Webhook it is possible to specify additional headers.
    Therefore HTTP basic authentication or a custom header with an access key
    can be used. There is currently no support for other types of authentication.

    ## Error Handling

    ### Timeouts

    A response is expected within 30 seconds. 

    ### Response codes

    The system expects a 2xx response code. Everything else is regarded as an
    error condition.

    ### Retry on Error

    Most likely this is too complex. So we won't retry? This is a bit nasty but
    acceptable if we can assume that there is reliable network connectivity?
    
    
    ### Permanent failures

    Deactivate hooks that never worked automatically after a few times?
    Deactivate hooks in case http status implies permanent failure?
